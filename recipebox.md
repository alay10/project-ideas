# Recipe Box

## Problem:
Throughout my life I have always struggled with keeping track of recipes I like to make. Either I would write it down and lose it or I would bookmark online recipes and dislike the website's design and user interface. I've noticed that my friends also have these problems. Since written cookbook are pretty common, I thought it would be convenient to have an online version.

## Summary: 
My project idea is a recipe organizer app. I think this could be a phone app or a desktop app. The user would put their own recipe or copy and paste a recipe from elsewhere and put it in a file. The user may put notes and pictures as well. The application will allow the user to easily organize and find their recipes.

## Features
Possible features include: 
- Find recipes by typing in keywords, like an advanced version of control f.
- The app will start listing recipes that contain your keywords and narrow down as you type more.
- Organize recipes by meal type, e.g. breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert
- Convert measurements based on recipe's serving size
- Optional section to store current kitchen ingredients
- Allow users to select recipes they'd like to make for the upcoming week, and creates a grocery list based on needed ingredients (would consider previous bullet point and disregard ingredients user already has in their kitchen)
- Social aspect that allows users to share their recipes with friends/family on the platform
- Have a trending section where user can view other users' recipes and like or save them

## Possible Languages and Tools
- The backend storing everything could be created with c++.
- The user interface could be created with a GUI framework for Python.

## Users
The target audience for this website is anyone who cooks regularly. Some users could simply use this website for recipe storage while others might make use of its features that create an easier time with weekly planning. I think parents and large families would get more use from this site since they may need more help with planning out meals and grocery trips.
