# Project Idea # 
My project idea is for a recipe repository. This repository would hold recipes entered by the user, and it would be searchable, so that it is easier to find your desired recipe. 

## Problem Being Solved ## 
I struggle to find recipes that I've used in the past because I usually click on many links before finding the one I end up using. Later, when I want to use it again, I have to click back through all of them and hope I remeber which one was the right one. This repository would mean that I could save the recipes I want in a more meaningful way then simply screenshotting them or storing the link in my notes app.

## Major Features ## 
- easy to use interface for entering recipes
- multiple ways of finding recipes through keywords and ingredients
- way to check off steps and ingredients when using your recipes

## Languages, Tools, etc. ## 
- use c++ to create the structures for storing recipe information
- no idea about the UI aspect yet

## Target Consumer ## 
anyone who uses recipes frequently and doesn't have a great way of keeping them straight.
