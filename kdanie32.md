# Project Idea: Chess Engine
### History 
Chess is a game that has been around for what seems like forever and there have been many masters of the game throughout the years. However, with the introduction of chess computers they have quickly made the human chess player obsolete. Every year there are human competitions in the game of chess and computer competitions. 
### Problem to Solve
I want to create one of these chess engines. The problem being solved is making a chess engine with a minimum of an 1800 rating. 
### Features
Some of the major features of the chess engine is going to be the speed and efficiency of the program. It will also be able to play at various levels of play in chess.
### Code Base
 The engine will be written in c++ and python combined. The python will be used to create a machine learning module using pytorch. The c++ will be the main driver of the program. We will test out various styles of approaching the problem including brute force tactics. The people that will use this program are people who are trying to discover new chess strategies.
