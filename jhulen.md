##Brief Project Summary

Our group plans to make a user-friendly inventory system to help small businesses manage inventory. The software will assist businesses in tracking sales, keeping items in stock, and ordering more products when inventory is low. Additionally, we plan to either create a point of sale system or incorporate an existing PoS system to keep track of inventory in real time. We propose beginning with a csv file for inventory input and addadditonal features in order of priority. The project is based on relatively simple features, allowing for lots of flexibility for additonal features.
