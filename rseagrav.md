#Time's Up

#####Summary

Time's up is a game based on communication skills. The game is played between 2 teams, 
that select a collection of items to have to describe, give a hint for using only one word, 
or act it out, for their team to correctly guess.

#####Problem Being Solved

You ever need an ice breaker for a large group of people that isnt just "Where are you from?", 
"What are your career aspirations?", "What do you think about the weather?". Having someone 
have to act out or describe a croissant in one word is a much better way to meet people.
