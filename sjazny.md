# Project Idea

## Abstract
Most morning alarms are annoying and easily ignorable. 
The main conflict with this is that most bedside alarms and phone alarms can be disabled with the press of a button or tap of a screen. 
An alternative alarm would be one that requires the user to commit a more exertive action to disable the alarm. 
This idea proposes a phone application that rquires the user to solve a basic puzzle or math problem before it is disabled.

## Details
This application would only propose the user with a puzzle that is basic for their knowledge level. 
- It would be interactive and adaptive, thus not giving a 13-year-old a puzzle that seems basic to a 23 year-old. 
- The aim for this is to gently get the user to exert brainpower for a split few seconds before the alarm is disabled.
- This, hopefully, decreases the chance of them falling back asleep right after.

## Features and Language
The major features of this App would have to be very UI-centric. It would have a swift and fast interface that is intuitive to use. 
- The Alarm screen would preferably be a dark-neutral color as to be gentle on the eyes. 
- The puzzles would range from simple tic-tac-toe problems to basic math equations. 
- The puzzles would shift every day. Therefore, a user might get “12 + 3” / “answer: 15” one day and “if I am facing North and have to go west, which direction to I turn?” / “answer: left.”

The language for this would most-preferably be python. Due to this, any open-source app building engine can be used to direct this application.

## Target Audience
The demographic for this app would honestly be anyone under the sun. Most of us have alarms for school, work, hobbies, hangouts, etc. 
This app could be utilized by a very broad range of people.
