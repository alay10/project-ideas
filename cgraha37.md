## THE "Gamified" Dating App


### Dating Has Been "Gamified" 
---   
Nowadays, the dating scene is being pushed online as more people are opting to meet their potiental one and only on apps such as Tinder and Bumble. What sets these apps apart from dating services such as eHarmony is the fact that they have been slightly "gamified", rendering users addicted to the thrill of endlessly swipping on profiles in hopes of finding the perfect match. But unlike games, when playing around on dating apps, not everyone always has fun. What I have in mind is a dating app that intentionally leans into the "game" aspect and allows every user to have fun whether they find their true love or not. 

### All Fun and Games
---   
This idea can go one of two ways: after creating a profile and answering some preliminary questions, compatible users will take part in a game show style event reminiscent of "The Dating Game" where they will compete against each other to win the "match". The second way is closer to a dating simulator where users create a profile with a pixel avatar, talk/play mini games, and must both agree before they can reveal photos of each other. 

### The Features
---   
Like within all dating apps, users would be able to build their own profile, add information about their interests/hobbies, and specify their preferences. Unlike other dating apps, users will be able to create pixel avatars, and will be placed in "pools" based on their compatibilty ratings, and either participate in game shows styled events or play mini games with each other. Given the nature of this idea there is a large degree of freedom when it comes to additional features.

### The Languages
---   
The idea is that this app could be available on desktop as well as mobile devices, but for this class it makes more sense to develope it as a web application. With that assumption in mind, it would be built with the use of web development languages such ass CSS, HTML, and JavaScript but this is subject to change.

### The Consumer
---   
The target audience members are adults looking for a complete change of pace when it comes to the emotional roller coaster that is the dating scene.
