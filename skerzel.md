#Project Idea: Cat Cafe Game

The "problem" that is being solved is boredom as this is just a cool little game that we plan to have nice, but simple, art and be fun to play whenever you want to kill time.

I'm not very sure how the game is going to turn out but if I were to pick a direction some of the features I would add would be:
* A sort of "Pokedex" style menu where you can see all the cats that you've interacted with and some neat facts about them like their breed, nature(aggressive, calm and such) and other things like favorite food.
* Making sure there are a good amount of breeds and diverse cats that each cat feels like a new stand-alone cat
*Maybe add an accelerated time mechanic where the days will pass and you can interact with different cats at different parts of the day and such
*Be able to feed and pet cats of course

The main languages/tools we will use is C++ and godot but we will need some way to include arts and sounds all together as well.

We have ideas of putting this on Steam (a game distribution platform) either for free or a couple of dollars for people to play and enjoy.
