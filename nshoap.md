# Inventory Project Idea
## Summary
Essentially, the idea is that we create inventory management software for businesses to help manage and maintain their inventory.  It will make their life easier by aiding them in restocking inventory and giving useful information about the inventory.  We're going to start with the minimal functionality expected from something like this and implement the additional quality of life features once we have the base finished.

## Problem Addressed
Businesses, specifically small businesses, often struggle with inventory management; it can be overwhelming to correctly restock the items that need to be restocked, while also making sure to avoid overstocking.

## Features
1. Inventory Management - Database of items the store carries.
1. Stock suggestions - suggestions such as "order more" or "this item needs a discount".
1. Easy to use user interface

## Languages / Tool Sets
The program is going to be written in C++, and its interface is going to use the QT framework.  Depending on how we decide to handle the inventory, we may use something like MySQL.

## Target Customers
Business owners, primarilly small business owners.  Larger corporations often have in-house point of sale software and inventory management software, but they may still be interested.  However, most small business owners likely don't have a quality tool for their inventory management; we aim to make it incredibly easy to use to target inexperienced, small business owners.
