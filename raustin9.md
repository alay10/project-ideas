## Project Summary
Music is one of the world's largest industries making billions of dollars every year.
This is due largely to the fact that there are many variations on how to enjoy the content.
Many people love to listen on their way to work, play a song while cleaning, and much more.
And many love to critique.

For such a large market of people who love to critique on twitter, youtube, facebook, and more there is no centralized forum in which to review music.
I am proposing an app that would allow critics to leave reviews and comments underneath songs and albums.
The UI would be very similar to what normal music streaming platforms are in terms of how the user interacts and navigates, but instead of listening to songs, they would leave their thoughts on them.

## Features
* Star rating or rating out of /10 on albums and songs
* users can leave their reviews on albums and songs
* other users can interact through responding to others' reviews

## Languages and Technologies
* This would be a web application and then in the future potentially a mobile app
* React for the front end (potentially Nextjs)
* MongoDB and contentful for the backend
* IF it gets to mobile development, it will likely be similar backend technologies with React Native to build the app

## Target Customer Audience
This would largely be marketed towards those who already spend energy spreading their opinions, and it would be a place to bring them all together. It would be friendly to casual listeners, but the majority of users would likely be avid critics.
