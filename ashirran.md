# Universal Converter Website

In the past I have used converter websites, but I had never found a good universal converter that I could rely on. My project idea is to create a website using HTML that takes a user file and converts it to an appropriate file format. Some of the main converters include: an audio converter, video converter, image converter, ebook converter, document converter and zip converter. The converters will also be able to make files compatible with apple and android devices. I don't think this is all that will be on the website but for now that is what I have for a starting basis. In order to program the converter, I was thinking using C++ or python would be good. I am not familiar with programming a website so I will have to do a lot of research into HTML to make this a reality. My initial plan would be to make this a free to use website but later on that idea could change. 

The problem that is being solved would be my own personal issue in the past with converter websites saying they are free when they are not or converter websites that only did one type of conversion such as only PDF to DOC. I hope to be able to add as many different types of converters as possible, but given our timeframe there might be less than initially planned. Hopefully every day PC users would be able to use the product to more effectively handle all of their files!
