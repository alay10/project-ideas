# Casino Strategy Trainer
Gambling is fun, but the odds are alway stacked against you. Shouldn't it be time you get the advantage over the house.
This project would be to develop an application that will help your odds of winning in a variety of common casino table
games, and to maximize your potential profits.

## Features
This program will allow the user to choose from a variety of common casino games, such as:
   * Blackjack
   * Baccarat
   * 3-Card Poker
   * Possibly Craps and Roulette

The user will then be able to input various game related data: such as held cards, bet amounts, previous hands, number of decks, etc.
The program will then determine the statistically best move or bet to make, as well as display the winning odds and house edge of any game.

## Coding
This program would be coded using C++, with possibly some Python or Java as well.

## Potential Customers
The potential buyers of this program would be for people who want to get better at these table games, with the program being able to teach them when the
best times to play a hand or go all in are. Another source of more nefarious customers would be those wanting to cheat and gain an unfair advantage.
