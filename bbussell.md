# The Fireball Game

A no-nonsense simplified platform fighter. A game where two people control characters and try to outmanuaver past the other and push the opponent off of the map.

## Problem

This game aims to work more as a tool for fighting game players wishing for a game where they can focus more on the fundamentals of the game and less on the flashy moves that often overcomplicate and obfsucate the core gameplay in all platform fighters.

## Features

3 different characers all embodying different fighting archetypes.

### The Rushdown
This characters goal is to get in your face and scare you with overwhelming moves that are high reward but require a close proximity to work.

### The Zoner
This characters goal is to keep you away. Using fireballs and other tools to counter the rushdowns aggressive gameplay

### The Grappler
This characters goal is to bait their opponent into commiting and then punishing them accordingly with moves that require a bit of wind up but and move through fireballs they directly counter the gameplay of the zoner while remaining vulnerable to the rushdown character.

## Tools

This project could be done using Love2d or GoDot... Likely will be something using C++ as my partner would like to stick with that.
Likely will use a framework for handling graphics.

## Demand

This will satisfy the demand most games have as well as be a fun entertainng game people could play on their phones with their friends
