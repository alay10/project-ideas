# Project Proposal 
### Marcos Garcia

## Overview

### Problem
When looking to buy or trade items, it is often difficult finding what you want. Wether it's large items like furniture or small items like clothing, it is difficult
to find what you are looking to buy or even where to sell/trade locally. This is due to the endless amount of bargain services, such as Ebay, Facebook Marketplace, and
Craigslist.

### Solution
The project is a website and app that allows a user to search up an item they are trying to buy locally. The app will then show the best results from multiple e-commerce websites, such as Craiglist, Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, Ebay, etc. Then, the results will send the user directly the webpage of the item being sold.

## Major Features
- Filtering distance from current location
- Filtering based on price
- Filtering based on websites
- Bookmarking items
- Wishlist, and notifying when new listing of item is found

## Languages, Tool Sets, Third-Party Code, etc.
- Code will be taken from the search algorithms of the websites data is taken from
- Python
- HTML
- CSS

## Who would buy this solution?
People from all ages, especially growing cities receiving new residents and college towns. More specifically, young adults are the core audience for this idea as
they are either moving in and out of towns and cities.

### How it would be marketed
The website would be marketed through social media as that is where young adults spend most of their time browsing the internet. It will be marketed as an easy method
to find what you're looking for on a cheap budget ratehr than spending hours on multiple different e-commerce websites.

### Probability of Success
Pretty likely to succeed if correctly marketed toward young adults, specifically in college towns and growing cities.
