## Project Summary and Problem being solved
Game statistics are important for anyone who takes gaming even moderately seriously. I propose making an application that not only tracks a players performance, but also provides feedback and tips for improvement. First part of this app, is rather simple: just record data (such as accuracy and win/loss ratio). The second part is a little more reliant on a large sample of data, from which analysis and feedback can occur. This app would provide guidance for players looking to enhance their skills.

## Features
As previously stated, some features would include:
* Tracking data of individual players
* Analysis and comparison of player data with fanbase's data
* Team comparison (how well a combination of players work together)

## Languages and toolsets
* C++ for the backend structure of the project
* Any language that is good for developing a GUI

## Customer base
People interested in using data analysis to improve their gaming skills.
