# Better Translator

If any of you have ever tried to use google translate you know it can be a little weird. My hope is to improve this. I would like to build a website that can translate english to spansh and vice versa using AI to improve the translation.This would obviously help to solve a few problems. First it would improve text translation for those trying to learn the venacular of a new language. It would also improve communcation in general across languages. 

My hope is to have simple interface for the app in which the user can enter text and the translated text will be returned. It will most likely require an internet connection and a feature to choose the translated language. Depending on the difficulty we could add lessons for learning.
This description is a little short but the project is rather straight foward though it still has some serious complexity. My goal would to have a high quality AI model that actually provides a level of translation that is competive/improved over what is currently available. Of course if we find this to be easier than we expect, which I don't think will happen, we can always added features for learning words and phrases.


The tools we would need to build this include:
* xcode
* android studio
* java, C#
* python
* Some server stack
* python libraries for neural net models
