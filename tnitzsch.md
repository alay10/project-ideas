Our groups idea is a personal project tracker it would allow the user to create trees of tasks and sub-tasks that let you track your progress and completion of each task and displays progress percentage of each parent task and the whole project, with configurable weights. This problem helps to address the issue of project management especially in groups, as it allows for easy visualization of what has been done, what needs to be done, and how much progress has been made. Some planned features include a visualizer for project and sub-task completion, and integration for multiple users. The project is planned to be developed in c++ as that's what most group members are familiar with, though that is subject to change as it hasn't really been a topic for discussion yet. This program has a very wide scope of users as it is useful to anyone who might have any sort of long term project. It could be useful for students to track their progress on assignments, or group projects, as well as being useful in professional environments for the management of long term or group projects.
