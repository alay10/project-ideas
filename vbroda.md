## Brief Summary
For our project, we have decided to create a program that will help businesses with inventory management. The goal is to create something in depth enough to where as long as the system is updated by the user, they will be able to tell what is going on with their supplies. 

## Problem Being Solved
Storage and inventory supply is something that most businesses have to deal with. From warehouses to restaurants to offices, it can be hard to keep track of everything. Because of this, a program that can help keep track of everything in one place can save a lot of time and energy.

## Major Features
- In depth Item Information 
- User Friendly Interface
- Easy viewing/editing of Items

## Other Features 
- Log in system
- Picture integration
- Map feature for basic storage layout

## Languages being used
Our team plans on using c++ and Qt for the user interface.

## Who is this for
This is for any business that wants a simpler way to keep track of inventory. It will be useful for management for keeping track of total supplies and for general employees for having detailed information with what they are working with.
