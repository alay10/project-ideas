# A Better Jira / Project Management Website

### Summary

---
A clone of the Jira project management website that improves the user interface, organization, and and accessibility.


### Problem

---
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the website, Jira is a project management website that is often used hand-in-hand with the Agile/Scrum methodology. It features a kanban board, roadmaps, reports, and the ability to create "cards" to represent tasks on the kanban board. Unfortunately, the website is very inconsistent in terms of performance, is unorganized, and is not friendly to new users. This project aims to create a similar website with the goal of improving upon these areas.

### Features

---

* Kanban board with cards that can be moved to represent progress on different tasks. The board would also feature an organizational tool to view the overall goal that each task falls under.
  * This would also feature a filter, allowing the user to filter cards based on progress or overall goal.
* Roadmap/backlog with a more organized and user-friendly interface. 
* Ability to create folders for different projects, each of which would contain a kanban board for the project.
  * This would be done in a much more organized way and make it easier for users to view the different projects they are a part of.

### Languages & Tools

---

* HTML / SCSS
* Ember.js or React.js for JS framework
* NodeJS for backend
* MongoDB or MySQL for Database

### Consumers

---
Ideally, this app would just be a free online web app for anyone to use for project management. It could also be used as a glorified planner/to-do list for everyday tasks.
