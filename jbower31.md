# Basic Workout Tracker - Justin Bowers

## Summary: 
###     I want to create a simple desktop application that can be used to
###     track workouts and easily monitor progress. It should be more user
###     friendly than spreadsheets, while providing similar visualization
###     of the user's progress.

---------------

## Problem Being Solved:
###     The first issue is that many workout trackers are no more 
###     effective than just using a notepad to write everything down.
###     Many also do not allow for useful visualization of the user's
###     progress. It could be incredibly useful and fun to see how
###     one's strength and performance has developed with just the 
###     press of a button.

----------------

## Major Feature:
### Some feautures I would like to include in this project are -
        1. Easily visualize tracked data
        2. Allow for multiple "profiles"
        3. A library of exercises
        4. Reccomendations on how to improve when progress slows.
        5. A simple, accessible UI

------------------

## Languages, tools, etc:
###     I plan for the bulk of of the project to be done in Python.
###     I am quite unfamiliar with UI's and such, so I am open to
###     suggestion when it comes to tools for developing that part
###     of the project.

------------------

## Target Consumer:
###     This project would be perfect for any regular lifter that
###     would like a way to consolidate their performance logs. It
###     is also useful for any trainers who wish to document all of
###     their clients' info to streamline their processes.
