# BlockShare

BlockShare is a web application that would allow people to share files without the risk of losing owership or rights to their files. BlockShare uses a blockchain to keep a record of how files have been shared. Once a file is uploaded to the BlockShare server, a unique hash containing data about the owner of the file, the date of its upload, and its contents will be created. This hash will be linked to the file in the application so that its original creator can always be verified. 

# Why does the world need this?
