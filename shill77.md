# Project Idea
## PDF Manipulation +
Create a free-to-use web based solution for basic PDF manipulation:
-rotating
-combining
If time allows, the ability to print multiple PDFs at the same time without opening each one individually.

The free version of Adobe Acrobat only allows for viewing of PDFs, in order to do any manipulation, 
including something as basic as rotating or combining multiple PDFs the user must pay $13/month. It's 
also incredibly inconvenient to have to open multiple documents, and go through all the steps to print. 
For instance if a client has downloaded bank statements for the last year and each months statment is in
a different document, they would have to go through the process of printing for 12 different documents. 
Instead they should be able to just select all 12 documents and print all. 

### Major Features:
-website with multiple tabs
1. a click and drag or upload box to combine files and then redownload
2. a click and drag or upload box to rotate files 90/180/270 degrees and then redownload the new file
3. a click and drag or upload box to print multiple files

### Languages and toolsets
-C++ for the actual manipulation
-HTML, CSS, Javascript for the website
-Not sure about toolsets, but would be open to teammate input

### Customer base
This would most be most useful to small business owners and the average consumer. 
The product would be free to use. I personally found a need for such a resource during the summer, 
while doing data input for a person completing a forensic audit for a lawsuit. It required inputting data
from multiple scanned checkbooks into an excel spreadsheet and then saving that spreadsheet into a PDF. Multiple
times I received checkbooks that were scanned in sideways, making it difficult to read. After sending about 15 
different PDFs to the client they asked if there was an easier way to print all 15. I didn't have a solution for
them. Had another client who was emailed the front and back of an important document as two seperate PDFs. And 
again I had no way to combine them into one without forking over $13 to Adobe.
