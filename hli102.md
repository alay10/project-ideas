# Project

This project is about making basic subtitles for vedios. It enables quick creation and access to each subtitle, making a timeline of each subtitle so that text files can be placed directly into the subtitles.

# Problem

This allows for quicker access to subtitle timelines for companies that need to quickly produce subtitles for TV series, as well as translation work.

# Features

* Can customize the use of shortcut keys to achieve different subtitle effects
* Can jump directly to the next one after making a subtitle
* Can have multiple subtitle tracks

# Tools

* C++
* Javascript

# Target Audience

Allows videos with scripts to process their own subtitles in a faster way, speeding up subtitle production for movies and TV series.
