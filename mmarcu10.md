<p>my idea is to create a budgeting app that will be aimed at college students and young adults. Many college students and young adults have very little experience with finances so it can be quite difficult for them to manage their money. I would like to have a few fetures, including a subscription tracker, a daily allowance calculator, and integration with your banking accounts. I would likely use javascript to complete this project and would like to create a webclient that would be ussable on pc and mobile.</p>
