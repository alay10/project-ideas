# A PDF text file to Audio Convertor
## Summary
I am going to use Web Page as my user interface. Users just need to drop their PDF file into a drop box and click Convert, the program would automatically of the conversion for the user and end up with an audio file. Since I am an international student, I understand the hardship of learning English, therefore, beside the feature of converting pdf text file into audio, another feature of this program is is to translating. Currently, it may just supports a couple of linguistic translation. When people who is not familiar with English want to use this program, they can just drop their pdf text file into the the box and hit Translate Button, a PDF file with translated text would come out.

## Tools and techniques to be used:
- HTML/CSS
- Python with web framework Django
- The library googletrans 
- Database: MySQL  

## Potential Clients 
- High school or college students who are required to do huge amount of e-book reading.
- People who have to browse through the seemingly endless pages of terms and conditions on an important official document everyday
